# Fraud-Detection-Using-machine-learning
Today, we can say that the fraud is one of the major issues we are facing in our day to day lives. This majorly happens in banking sectors, Online shopping sites, Insurance sectors etc. Overcoming these kinds of issues has always been a very big task for all the fraud detectors and risk analysts. Though the technology is growing rapidly the same way the fraud growth is increasing on a higher scale. There are different types of fraudulent activities like: 

•	Manipulation of genuine cards.

•	Creation of fake cards.

•	Lost credit cards.

•	Fraudulent tele-marketing.

Apart from these, there are also many ways of obtaining information without the approval of authorized account holder.

Statement of project problem:
	Finding an option for the early detection of the fraudulent activities would be very helpful. This might be difficult for any organization to detect each fraudulent activity because they can see thousands of such activities occurring frequently. The main goal of this project is to detect fraud using machine learning as this process makes helpful for the organizations to solve such issues.

Navin Kasa, undertook a capstone project part of the Master of Science in Data Science program that addresses credit card fraud detection through a semi-supervised approach, in which clusters of account profiles are created and used for modeling classifiers. Accounts are profiled based on their behavioral trends and clustered into similar groups. Groups are further identified as distinct customer segments based on purchase characteristics such as amount, frequency or distance.

Objectives of the study:
After extracting the required columns in the dataset I’m going to check the number of fraudulent activities done according to the gender and then perform the test and train for the data.
Here I am going to perform different machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, confusion matrix, decision tree etc.


Research analysis:	
I have always been interested to know how the fraud is happening and how are the people trying to overcome it. I will be performing the data cleaning first and once the Data comes to a proper shape; I will do some exploratory data analysis. In the next step I would like to perform on the data is building a machine learning model. I have planned to split the data into training and test sets and then I will be performing the logistic regression algorithm and get the accuracy score.
