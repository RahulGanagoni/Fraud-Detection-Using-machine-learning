# Fraud-Detection-Using-machine-learning

Today, we can say that the fraud is one of the major issues we are facing in our day to day lives. This majorly happens in banking sectors, Online shopping sites, Insurance sectors etc. Overcoming these kinds of issues has always been a very big task for all the fraud detectors and risk analysts. Though the technology is growing rapidly the same way the fraud growth is increasing on a higher scale. There are different types of fraudulent activities like: 
•	Manipulation of genuine cards.
•	Creation of fake cards.
•	Lost credit cards.
•	Fraudulent tele-marketing.

**Statement of project problem:**

Finding an option for the early detection of the fraudulent activities would be very helpful. This might be difficult for any organization to detect each fraudulent activity because they can see thousands of such activities occurring frequently. The main goal of this project is to detect fraud using machine learning as this process makes helpful for the organizations to solve such issues.

Navin Kasa, undertook a capstone project part of the Master of Science in Data Science program that addresses credit card fraud detection through a semi-supervised approach, in which clusters of account profiles are created and used for modeling classifiers. Accounts are profiled based on their behavioral trends and clustered into similar groups. Groups are further identified as distinct customer segments based on purchase characteristics such as amount, frequency or distance.

**Objectives of the study:**

After cleaning the data and extracting the required columns in the dataset I’m going to check the number of fraudulent activities. In one of the columns, we can 0’s and 1’s where the 0 represents non fraudulent activities and 1’s represent the fraudulent activities. This column helps us to work on finding the accuracy using different machine learning algorithms.

**About the dataset:**

I have chosen this dataset from Kaggle. This dataset consisted around 2lakh records from which I have taken 15000 records for my convenience. The dataset has 31 columns where the time, amount and class are the important columns and all others are different attributes contributing to these columns which are taken from V2 to V29.

**Research analysis:**	

I have always been interested to know how the fraud is happening and how are the people trying to overcome it. I will be performing the data cleaning first and once the Data comes to a proper shape; I will do some exploratory data analysis. In the next step I would like to perform on the data is building a machine learning model. I have planned to split the data into training and test sets and then I will be performing the logistic regression algorithm and get the accuracy score.

**Data analysis and visualizations:**

I have uploaded a pynb file where we can see all the analysis and visualizations clearly.

**Conclusion:**

By performing machine learning algorithms, I can conclude by finding and comparing the accuracy from decision tree and logistic regression. Here, using python helps in providing the visualizations of various attributes.
